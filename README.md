# Elmore County Parcel Scraper

Elmore County parcel addresses are missing "Street" suffixes. If a street does not end in a recognized suffix or directional, I add this.

Unit numbers are given after the address number and before the street name. It is impossible to distinguish between Unit A and a name like "A Street". Manual cleanup required.
